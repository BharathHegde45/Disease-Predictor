# Disease-Predictor
The project will focus on developing a disease prediction model that is going to be of great importance in efficiently predicting different diseases using suitable machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Support Vector Classifier. A model has been envisioned for providing the probability of different diseases so that diagnosis can be made at an early stage to avoid missent cases or near-miss events. This project is envisioned to involve data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and finally, the evaluation using appropriate performance metrics.
